KTICHEN CHAOS SINGLE - PLAYER

Kitchen Chaos is a single-player, fast-paced cooking game developed using Unity.
This project was created by following CodeMonkey’s Kitchen Chaos tutorial series and extended with custom features for learning and improvement purposes.

ABOUT THE GAME

The player manages a kitchen and prepares different recipes under time pressure.
Ingredients must be collected, chopped, cooked, and combined correctly to complete customer orders and earn points.

The main goal is to complete as many correct orders as possible before time runs out.
